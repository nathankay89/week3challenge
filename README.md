# Password Generator Starter Code

## Description

My motivation behind this project was to create a website that I could utilize to quickly and easily create secure passwords for myself. I built this project so that I could not only showcase my coding skills, but also create a solution for a common problem in my life: creating unique passwords. This web app allows me to very quickly create passwords that are unique and do not cross over with existing passwords that I have. I learned more about javascript objects, methods, and arrays. I also learned how to engage the resources available to me to solve coding problems.
